# The Case for Application-Aware Deduplication and Duplication Avoidance in Earth Sciences

Note: This blog post is part 1 of a 3-part blog series on efficient practices to minimize ROT data in domains like Earth Sciences.

ROT (Redundant, Obsolete, and Trivial) data is a widespread issue in storage systems. Effectively managing ROT data is essential for enhancing storage capacity, lowering costs, and optimizing performance. This is especially true for fields dealing with massive amounts of data, such as Earth Sciences. While there are existing solutions for deduplication implemented at the generic storage level (e.g., ZFS file systems), application-aware strategies often present a more efficient solution. This blog examines how application-aware **deduplication** and **duplication avoidance** techniques, like copy-on-write (CoW) and metadata-based cloning, can more effectively address ROT data than generic storage-level deduplication.

## Deduplication vs. Duplication Avoidance: Application-Aware Efficiency

Deduplication is a technique originally developed in storage systems to remove redundant copies of data. It identifies identical data blocks and keeps only one copy, thus conserving storage space. This method is effective in many contexts, such as backup, archiving, and shared environments.

Application-aware strategies, such as copy-on-write and metadata cloning, avoid duplication right from the source by ensuring redundant data isn't written initially. This approach reduces the need for deduplication, as the system prevents redundancy before it even occurs.

## The Power of Deduplication: Application-Specific Use Cases

Backups inherently involve storing multiple copies of data over time, with minor changes. Deduplication eliminates duplicate blocks across versions, minimizing storage overhead.

When multiple users work with the same datasets, deduplication ensures only one copy of the data is stored.

In a JupyterHub environment, where users train machine learning models on the same dataset, deduplication cuts down on storage requirements. However, deduplication can be costly and slow down processes, so it is typically used only during data publication or archiving, not for live usage. Users who copy large files across directories in a shared file system create duplication. Some applications may not be aware of data redundancy and may create duplicate copies. Deduplication compensates for this inefficiency.

## Copy-on-Write and Metadata Cloning: Avoiding Duplication at the Source

Copy-on-Write (CoW) is a technique that defers the creation of new copies of data until a change actually occurs. When a new version of data is needed, CoW doesnâ€™t create an entirely new copy of the dataset. Instead, it initially references the original data, and only writes the changed portions. This approach dramatically reduces unnecessary duplication, as only modifications are stored, and the original dataset is preserved until an update or change requires a new version. A common analogy can be seen in version control systems like **Git**. In Git, when a file is changed, it doesn't duplicate the entire file with every new commit. Rather, Git creates references (or pointers) to the unchanged data and only records the changes. This reduces storage usage and makes versioning more efficient.

However, this approach presents challenges when dealing with **large datasets**. In systems like Git, which are designed for smaller text files, it is relatively easy to handle changes and versions efficiently. But with large binary files or scientific datasets, this becomes more difficult. When datasets grow in size, tracking changes without creating excessive overhead becomes critical. If every tiny modification resulted in a large storage operation, the performance could be severely impacted, leading to high computational and storage costs. Thus, efficiently managing and tracking these changes without unnecessary duplication or overhead becomes paramount.

Similarly, **metadata cloning** works by creating lightweight references or pointers to the original data rather than duplicating it. The core idea is to store only the metadata (the pointers or references to the data) instead of the actual data itself. By using these references, you avoid duplication at the storage level. This method ensures that only the metadata is duplicated, while the underlying data remains unchanged and shared. In practice, metadata cloning can allow multiple datasets to share common data without requiring each one to hold a full copy, greatly reducing storage consumption.

For larger datasets, having an efficient and performant metadata layer becomes crucial. As the volume of data increases, the metadata layer plays a key role in ensuring that the system can quickly locate, access, and manage references to the data without suffering from significant performance degradation. An effective metadata layer ensures that changes can be tracked efficiently, and that storage systems remain responsive and scalable even with massive datasets. 

## Why Avoiding Duplication is Better Than Deduplication

1. Avoiding duplication removes the computational and memory overhead required for deduplication.
2. Duplication avoidance is a lightweight operation that boosts performance.
3. Application-level strategies ensure efficient handling of redundancy based on data structure and behavior.

In data science, teams often clone large datasets for analysis. In environments like JupyterHub, where users share datasets, libraries, and notebooks, duplication is minimized by sharing data without unnecessary replication. Data teams typically have access to a shared file system, which may act as a cache. Cloning would allow referencing files in this shared cache only once, while CoW ensures only modified data portions are stored, avoiding duplication.
