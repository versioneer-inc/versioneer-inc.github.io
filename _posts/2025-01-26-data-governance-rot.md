# Build up a Governance Strategy to Minimize ROT Data in Earth Sciences

**Note**: This blog post is part 3 of a 3-part series on practices to minimize ROT data in data-intensive domains like Earth Sciences.

As data continues to grow in volume and complexity, managing metadata effectively becomes increasingly crucial for organizations. Metadata management not only involves tracking data and its transformations but also ensures data accessibility, security, and compliance. Without an effective metadata management strategy, organizations can quickly find themselves overwhelmed by fragmented datasets, cloud overspent, and compliance failures.

Let's dive into the essential capabilities needed to handle metadata management, particularly when managing data across multiple cloud environments.

## Data Cataloging: Recording Data Assets and Their Uses

Data catalogs are central to effective metadata management. They record individual data assets, the data they contain, and their approved uses. A data catalog helps organizations organize their data, making it searchable and accessible to the right people.

There are two key types of data catalogs: physical and application-specific. Physical catalogs capture metadata like file size, hash values, and data location, ensuring the integrity and accessibility of data across different storage platforms (e.g., AWS, GCS). Application-specific catalogs, on the other hand, store domain metadata, which provides context about the data’s purpose, relationships, and usage within specific applications or workflows. By unifying both types, organizations can gain a comprehensive view of their data, ensuring only authorized users can access sensitive information.

## Search-based Metadata Management: Enhancing Data Searchability

As organizations accumulate vast amounts of data, metadata searchability becomes a key feature. Being able to search metadata (such as file types, data fields, or transformation history) enhances your ability to find specific data assets quickly, saving time and improving data discovery.

A data scientist may need to find data assets related to "high cloud coverage" or derived assets transformed trough a specific "pipeline version". With search-based metadata management, they can query the catalog for datasets that match their search criteria, saving time spent looking for the right data.

## Granular Access Control: Securing Data Access

Effective data governance requires granular access control to ensure that only authorized users or systems can access sensitive data. Role-based access control (RBAC) helps organizations define and enforce security policies at different levels, from user authentication to the data itself.

With granular access controls, the organization can define who can read, modify, or delete specific datasets, using it inside and even sharing it publicly or outside of the organization.

## Data Security: Ensuring Data Quality and Compliance

Data security is a foundational component of metadata management, encompassing areas such as data quality, usage monitoring, data lineage, and data loss prevention (DLP).  While some aspects of data security, like storage management and access controls, can be delegated to underlying managed object storage solutions, other critical elements, such as data lineage, must be integrated directly into the application domain. This is because understanding the journey of data—from its origin to any changes made to it, who made those changes, and how the data is shared—ensures complete visibility into its movement and transformation. This level of transparency is vital not only for ensuring that data remains trustworthy but also for maintaining auditability and meeting regulatory compliance requirements.

In addition, enforcing checksum validations and automating their verification plays a key role in ensuring data integrity. This helps detect any unintended alterations and maintain confidence in the quality of the data.

Tracking and logging all data changes creates a robust audit trail, ensuring full traceability of data transformations. This includes recording who made the changes, what exactly was changed, and when those changes occurred, enabling accurate reconstruction of the data’s history for compliance and analysis purposes.

## Data Versioning: Git-Like Operations to forster easy collaboration through cheap cloning

the concept of of Git-like operations on data management start to  transform how organizations handle, version, and collaborate on data.  Offers version control at the storage level allos providing historical views of data objects. it Enables recovery of accidentally deleted or overwritten raw data. tracking specific object versions, replicating key historical states (time travel) throh cheap cloning without duplicating data.

- **Branching: Isolating Work without Duplication**  
  Just like in software development, Git-like branching in data management allows teams to isolate their work in separate branches without duplicating the actual data. This operation conserves storage and allows for parallel work on various datasets without interference.

- **Committing Changes: Creating Immutable Snapshots**  
  Each commit in Git captures an immutable snapshot of the code. Similarly, in data management, committing changes captures a snapshot of the data at a specific point. This provides a clear audit trail and ensures reproducibility.

- **Merging Branches: Integrating Changes Safely**  
  Merging branches ensures that changes made in isolated branches can be integrated back into the main dataset smoothly, ensuring the data remains consistent and the pipeline operational.

- **Reverting Changes: Safeguarding Data Integrity**  
  Reverting changes allows data teams to undo mistakes and restore datasets to a prior, known good state, helping to maintain data integrity.

- **Tagging Commits: Labeling Key Data Milestones**  
  Just as developers use tags in Git to mark significant code releases, data teams can use tagging to mark key data milestones, such as the completion of a critical transformation or the data's final state before analysis.

### Why Data Practitioners Need Reproducibility
In data science and machine learning, reproducibility ensures that experiments can be repeated with the same inputs and methods to obtain consistent results. This is crucial for ensuring data integrity, validation, and compliance.

## Data Versioning: Git-Like Operations to Foster Collaboration

The concept of Git-like operations in data management is transforming how organizations handle, version, and collaborate on data. Git-style version control at the storage level provides historical views of data objects, allowing teams to track changes, recover accidentally deleted or overwritten raw data, and replicate key historical states (time travel) through cheap cloning—without the need for duplicating data.

In data science and machine learning, reproducibility ensures that experiments can be repeated with the same inputs and methods, yielding consistent results each time. This is crucial not only for maintaining data integrity but also for validating models and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements

- **Branching: Isolating Work without Duplication**  
  Just as in software development, Git-like branching in data management enables teams to isolate their work in separate branches without duplicating the actual data. This operation conserves storage and allows for parallel work on different datasets without interference or conflict.

- **Committing Changes: Creating Immutable Snapshots**  
  Each commit in Git captures an immutable snapshot of the code at a specific moment. Similarly, committing changes in data management captures a snapshot of the data at a particular point in time. This ensures a clear audit trail, which is essential for data reproducibility and traceability.

- **Merging Branches: Integrating Changes Safely**  
  Merging branches ensures that changes made in isolated branches can be smoothly integrated back into the main dataset. This maintains data consistency and ensures that the data pipeline continues to operate without disruption.

- **Reverting Changes: Safeguarding Data Integrity**  
  Reverting changes allows data teams to undo mistakes and restore datasets to a prior, known good state. This feature helps maintain data integrity, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring the continuity of analysis and decision-making.

- **Tagging Commits: Labeling Key Data Milestones**  
  Just as developers use tags in Git to mark significant code releases, data teams can use tags to mark key data milestones, such as the completion of a critical transformation or the final version of data before it enters an analytical phase.

## Conclusion

A solid metadata management strategy is crucial for data-intensive domains like Earth Sciences, especially in decentralized setups leveraging multiple storage locations across different cloud providers. Implementing the above capabilities enables:

1. **Auditability and Transparency:** Automatic tracking of all changes ensures compliance and transparency.
2. **Collaboration:** Teams can work in parallel, isolating their changes in branches and merging them back into the main dataset.
3. **Reproducibility:** Changes can be rolled back to previous states, ensuring results are consistent and verifiable.
4. **Data Integrity:** Reverting and merging operations maintain high data quality and prevent errors.

By adopting these practices, organizations can build data governance frameworks that are comprehensive, scalable, and capable of handling complex, multi-cloud environments.
